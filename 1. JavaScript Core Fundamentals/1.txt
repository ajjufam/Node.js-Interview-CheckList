Variables are Containers for Storing Data
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const

* Automatically => x=10, y="devil"

NOTE : It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.

=>>>>>>>
* var => var name="ajju", var number=20
    var in JavaScript is function-scoped, meaning it’s only visible within the function in which it is declared 
    — even if it's inside a block like if, for, or {}
<<<<<<<=

=>>>>>>>
* let => let name="Ajju", let number=20
    let in JavaScript is block-scoped, which means it is only accessible within the block {} where it's declared.
<<<<<<<=

=>>>>>>>
* const => const name="Ajju", const number=20
    const is a block-scoped variable declaration, similar to let.
    However, once a variable is declared with const, it cannot be reassigned.
    If the variable holds an object or array, the contents can still be modified, but the variable itself cannot be reassigned to a new value.

NOTE : For var and let value can be reassignable
