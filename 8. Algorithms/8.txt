Bubble Sort
    Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
    It keeps "bubbling" the largest value to the end in each pass â€” like bubbles rising in water ðŸ’§.

    How ?
    * Compare two adjacent elements.
    * Swap if the left is greater than the right.
    * Repeat until the array is sorted.

Algorithm 
    1. Start from the beginning of the array.
    2. Compare the current element with the next element.
    3. If the current element is greater than the next one, swap them.
    4. Move to the next pair of elements and repeat Step 2â€“3.
    5. After one full pass, the largest element will be at the end of the array.
    6. Repeat the above steps for the remaining (unsorted) portion of the array.
    7. Stop when no swaps are needed in a full pass (i.e., array is sorted).

Time Complexity
    Case    | Time
    Best    | O(n) (Already sorted)
    Average | O(nÂ²)
    Worst   | O(nÂ²)
    Space   | O(1)

Insertion Sort
    Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. Itâ€™s similar to how you might sort playing cards in your hand.

    How ?
    * Start from the second element (index 1).
    * Compare it with the elements before.
    * Shift all greater elements one position to the right.
    * Insert the current element in the correct position.

Time Complexity
    Case    | Time
    Best    | O(n) (alreay sorted)
    Average | O(nÂ²)
    Worst   | O(nÂ²)
    Space   | O(1)
