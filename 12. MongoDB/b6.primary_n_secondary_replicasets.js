// A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set through replication.
// Key roles:
// * Primary: The node that receives all write operations.
// * Secondary: Nodes that replicate the primary's data set and can be used for read operations or failover.

// Why ?
// * High Availability: If the primary fails, a secondary is promoted to primary automatically.
// * Data Redundancy: All data is replicated, minimizing risk of data loss.
// * Read Scaling (with readPreference): Read from secondaries in some scenarios.
// * Disaster Recovery: Backups can be taken from secondaries to avoid impacting production.

// üîµ How Replica Set Works:
// * Writes always go to the primary.
// * Secondaries constantly replicate the oplog (operation log) from the primary.
// * If the primary goes down, the remaining secondaries hold an election to pick a new primary.

üõ† Example: Setting Up a MongoDB Replica Set Locally
For demo purposes, we‚Äôll simulate a replica set using 3 mongod processes on your local machine.
üìÅ Step 1: Create Folders for Data Storage

mkdir - p / data / rs0 / data / rs1 / data / rs2;

üöÄ Step 2: Start MongoDB Instances (Different Ports)
Terminal 1:
mongod --replSet "rs0" --port 27017 --dbpath /data/rs0 --bind_ip localhost --oplogSize 128

Terminal 2:
mongod --replSet "rs0" --port 27018 --dbpath /data/rs1 --bind_ip localhost --oplogSize 128

Terminal 3:
mongod --replSet "rs0" --port 27019 --dbpath /data/rs2 --bind_ip localhost --oplogSize 128

üß† Step 3: Initiate the Replica Set
Open a mongo shell connected to one instance:
mongo --port 27017

Then run:
rs.initiate({
  _id: "rs0",
  members: [
    { _id: 0, host: "localhost:27017" },
    { _id: 1, host: "localhost:27018" },
    { _id: 2, host: "localhost:27019" }
  ]
})

‚úÖ Step 4: Check Replica Set Status
rs.status()
You‚Äôll see one member with stateStr: "PRIMARY" and others as "SECONDARY".

üß™ Step 5: Test Failover (Optional)
You can stop the primary mongod process (e.g., on port 27017), and after a few seconds, MongoDB will automatically 
elect a new primary from the secondaries.

üîÑ Example Use in Node.js with Mongoose
Connection string:
mongoose.connect(
  'mongodb://localhost:27017,localhost:27018,localhost:27019/mydb?replicaSet=rs0',
  { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true }
);

This ensures Mongoose is replica set‚Äìaware and can handle failover automatically.

üü£ Summary
* Primary: Handles all writes
* Secondary: Read-only replicas for redundancy & failover
* Replication keeps all nodes in sync
* Auto-failover ensures uptime
