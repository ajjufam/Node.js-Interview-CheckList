forEach()
    forEach() is an array method that executes a callback function once for each element in an array â€” in order.

    Why ?
    To iterate over an array and perform an action (like logging or modifying something externally) for each item.
<=======

=======>
a2.
map()
    map() creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array.

    Why ?
    To transform array elements without changing the original array.
<=======

=======>
a3.
filter()
    filter() creates a new array with only those elements that pass a condition (i.e., the callback returns true).

    Why ?
    To select specific elements from an array based on a condition, without changing the original array.
<=======

=======>
a4.
reduce()
    The reduce() method reduces an array to a single value by running a callback function on each element, 
    while carrying forward an accumulator.

    Why ?
    Use it when you want to accumulate or combine values in an array into:
    a single number (like sum or product),
    an object,
    or even another array.

some()
    The some() method in JavaScript is used to check if at least one element in an array 
    satisfies a given condition.

    Why ?
    It is useful when you want to test if any item in the array meets a specific condition, without needing 
    to check every item or loop through the entire array manually.
<=======

=======>
a6.
every()
    The every() method in JavaScript checks if every element in an array satisfies a given condition.

    Why ?
    It is useful when you want to test if all items in the array meet a specific condition.
<=======

=======>
a7.
find()
    The find() method in JavaScript is used to find and return the first element in an array that satisfies 
    a given condition. If no element is found, it returns undefined.

    Why ?
    It is useful when you want to retrieve the first matching element based on a specific condition in the array.
<=======

=======>
a8.
findIndex()
    The findIndex() method in JavaScript is used to find the index of the first element in an array that satisfies a given condition.
    If no element satisfies the condition, it returns -1.

    Why ?
    It is useful when you need to know the index of the first element that meets a specific condition, rather than the element itself.
<=======

=======>
a9.
includes()
    The includes() method in JavaScript checks if an array contains a specific value. 
    It returns true if found, otherwise false.

    Why ?
    Use it when you simply want to check if a value exists in an array.
