reduce()
    The reduce() method reduces an array to a single value by running a callback function on each element, 
    while carrying forward an accumulator.

    Why ?
    Use it when you want to accumulate or combine values in an array into:
    a single number (like sum or product),
    an object,
    or even another array.

some()
    The some() method in JavaScript is used to check if at least one element in an array 
    satisfies a given condition.

    Why ?
    It is useful when you want to test if any item in the array meets a specific condition, without needing 
    to check every item or loop through the entire array manually.
