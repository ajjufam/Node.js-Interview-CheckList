Callbacks
    A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function and is called later 
    (after some operation completes).

    Why ?
    * To handle asynchronous operations (like API calls, reading files).
    * To execute code in order — like “do this, then do that”.

Callback Hell 
    Callback Hell is when multiple nested callbacks are used, making the code look like a "pyramid" or 
    "staircase", and it's hard to read, maintain, or debug.

    Why
    When you have to do tasks in sequence, and each task depends on the result of the previous one 
    — especially in asynchronous code (like file reading, API requests, timers, etc).
