Callbacks
    A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function and is called later 
    (after some operation completes).

    Why ?
    * To handle asynchronous operations (like API calls, reading files).
    * To execute code in order — like “do this, then do that”.
<=======

=======>
a2.
Callback Hell 
    Callback Hell is when multiple nested callbacks are used, making the code look like a "pyramid" or 
    "staircase", and it's hard to read, maintain, or debug.

    Why
    When you have to do tasks in sequence, and each task depends on the result of the previous one 
    — especially in asynchronous code (like file reading, API requests, timers, etc).

    🔧 How to fix it?
    You can avoid callback hell by using:
    Named functions (instead of nesting)
    Promises
    Async/Await (most modern and readable)
<=======

=======>
a3.
Promises
    Promises in Js is a eventual execution or failure of an asynchronous operation.

    Why ?
    * To avoid callback hell.
    * To write cleaner, more readable asynchronous code.
    * To handle success and failure easily using .then() and .catch().

Promise States (pending, fulfilled, rejected)
    State     | What It Means
    pending   | The initial state — the promise is still processing.
    fulfilled | The operation completed successfully (resolved).
    rejected  | The operation failed (rejected with an error).
<=======

=======>
a5.
then()
    .then() is a method used with Promises to handle the result when the promise is fulfilled (successful).

    Why
    To perform some action after the async task completes successfully — like getting API data, finishing a delay, etc.
<=======

=======>
a6.
catch()
    .catch() is a method used with Promises to handle errors or rejected promises.

    Why ?
    To safely handle errors that may happen during asynchronous operations — like network failures, 
    bugs, or rejected promises.
<=======

=======>
a7.
finally()
    .finally() is a method that runs after a Promise is settled, no matter if it was resolved or rejected.

    Why ?
    To run cleanup code or final actions — like hiding a loader, closing a connection, etc. — 
    whether the operation succeeded or failed.
<=======

=======>
a8.
Promise Chaining
    Promise chaining is when you attach multiple .then() handlers one after another to handle 
    sequential asynchronous operations.

    Why 
    * Handle multiple async steps in order.
    * Avoid callback hell.
    * Keep code clean and readable.
<=======

=======>
a9.
async/await
    async/await is syntactic sugar over Promises.
    It lets you write asynchronous code in a synchronous style, making it easier to read and maintain.

    Why ?
    * Cleaner than .then() chains
    * Avoids callback hell
    * Makes async code easier to understand

Error Handling in async code
    Why ?
    Because async functions use Promises, and like any Promise, they can fail (get rejected).
    Without handling, errors can crash your app or leave you wondering what went wrong.

    How ?
    Use try...catch blocks inside async functions.
<=======

=======>
b2.
Promise.all
    Promise.all is a method that takes multiple promises and runs them in parallel.
    It waits for all of them to finish, and then gives you the results.

    Why ?
    To run many promises at the same time, and wait for all of them before continuing.

    VVVIMPPPPP
     It returns:
     ✅ a single promise that resolves when all given promises resolve.
     ❌ if any promise fails (rejects), the whole Promise.all fails.
