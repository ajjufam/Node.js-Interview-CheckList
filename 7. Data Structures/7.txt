Array
    * Array = a special data structure that holds a list of values in a single variable.
    * Each value inside the array is called an element.
    * Each element has an index (starts from 0).

    let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
    // Indexes:    0        1         2

    Why?
    * To store multiple related values together.
    * To organize data neatly.
    * To iterate easily over items (using loops).
    * To perform batch operations like sorting, filtering, mapping, etc.
    * Saves memory and makes code cleaner.
