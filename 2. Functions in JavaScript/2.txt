=======>
Function Declaration
    A Function Declaration is the most common way to define a function in JavaScript 
    using the function keyword.
<=======

=======>
Function Expression
    A Function Expression is when you assign a function to a variable.

    Unlike function declarations, function expressions are NOT hoisted, 
    so you cannot use them before they are defined.


Diff B/W regular function and function expression
// Feature                  | Function Declaration | Function Expression
// Keyword used             | function             | function (assigned to var)
// Hoisting                 | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No
// Can be anonymous         | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes (can be anonymous)
// Example Call Before Def. | ✅ Works             | ❌ Error

Arrow functions
    Arrow functions are a shorter and cleaner way to write function expressions introduced in ES6.

=======>
First-Class Functions
    In JavaScript, functions are treated as values, meaning they can be:
        * stored in variables,
        * passed as arguments,
        * returned from other functions.

        A Higher-Order Function is a function that does at least one of the following:
        1. Takes another function as an argument, or
        2. Returns a function.
