=======>
Function Declaration
    A Function Declaration is the most common way to define a function in JavaScript 
    using the function keyword.
<=======

=======>
Function Expression
    A Function Expression is when you assign a function to a variable.

    Unlike function declarations, function expressions are NOT hoisted, 
    so you cannot use them before they are defined.


Diff B/W regular function and function expression
// Feature                  | Function Declaration | Function Expression
// Keyword used             | function             | function (assigned to var)
// Hoisting                 | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No
// Can be anonymous         | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes (can be anonymous)
// Example Call Before Def. | ✅ Works             | ❌ Error
<=======

=======>
Arrow functions
    Arrow functions are a shorter and cleaner way to write function expressions introduced in ES6.
<=======

=======>
First-Class Functions
    In JavaScript, functions are treated as values, meaning they can be:
        * stored in variables,
        * passed as arguments,
        * returned from other functions.
<=======

=======>
Higher-Order Functions
        A Higher-Order Function is a function that does at least one of the following:
        1. Takes another function as an argument, or
        2. Returns a function.
<=======

=======>
Callback function
    A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed later, 
    usually after some task is done.
<=======

=======>
Function Currying
    A function with multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions, 
    each taking one argument at a time.

    NOTE : Function Currying is a type of Higher-Order Function.
    Because:
    It returns another function — and that's exactly what a higher-order function does.
<=======

=======>
Recursion
    Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a smaller piece of a bigger problem.

    It keeps calling itself until it reaches a base condition that stops the calls.

⚠️ Be Careful:
* Always include a base case to prevent infinite loops.
* Too many recursive calls can lead to stack overflow.

NOTE : 
Once it hits the base case, it starts returning the values back up the stack:
<=======

=======>
Pure Function
    A pure function is a function that:
    * Always returns the same output for the same input.
    * Doesn’t change anything outside itself (no side effects).
<=======

=======>
Impure Function
    A function is impure if it:
    * Modifies things outside itself (has side effects)
    * Returns different output for the same input

    NOTE : 
    Using console inside function is also a impure function, bcz console is a side effect
<=======

=======>
Anonymous Function
    An anonymous function is a function without a name.
    It's often used as a value—like passing to another function, assigning to a variable, etc.
<=======

=======>
IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
    An IIFE is a function that:
    * Defines itself
    * Immediately calls itself
    * It runs as soon as it’s defined — no need to call it separately!
<=======

=======>
call()
    The call() method lets you call a function and explicitly set the value of this inside that function.

    Used To borrow methods from one object and use them on another.
<=======

=======>
apply()
    apply() is just like call() — it allows you to call a function and set the this context.

    🔑 The only difference:
    While call() takes arguments separately,
    apply() takes them as an array.
<=======

=======>
bind()
    bind() is a method that creates a new function with a specific this value permanently bound to it.
    Unlike call() or apply(), which invoke the function immediately, bind() returns a new function 
    that you can call later.
<=======


// Method  | What it does                           | When it runs
// call()  | Changes this and calls immediately     | Now
// apply() | Like call(), but with array args       | Now
// bind()  | Returns a new function with bound this | Later

=======>
arguments objects
    arguments is an array-like object available inside regular functions (not arrow functions) that 
    holds all the arguments passed to the function.

    * To access arguments without knowing how many were passed.
    * Useful for functions that accept a variable number of arguments.
<=======

=======>
Default Parameters
    Default parameters allow you to set default values for function parameters if 
    no value or undefined is passed.

    Used To avoid undefined values and make your function more reliable by setting fallback/defaults.
<=======

=======>
Rest Parameters
    ...rest allows you to gather all remaining arguments into a single array.

    Used
    * To accept any number of arguments in a function.
    * It's a cleaner and more modern alternative to the arguments object.
<=======
