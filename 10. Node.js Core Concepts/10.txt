Global Objects
    Global Objects in Node.js are objects available in every module. You don't need to require them — 
    they are automatically available.

    Why?
    * Help you access useful values or functions anywhere in your code.
    * Reduce the need for importing common utilities.
    * Offer system-level functionalities like current directory, timers, buffer handling, etc.
<=======

=======>
a2.
CommonJS Modules
    CommonJS (CJS) is the module system used in Node.js.
    It allows you to import and export code between files.

    Why?
    * Helps split code into reusable parts.
    * Keeps code organized and maintainable.
    * Built-in support in Node.js (no setup needed).
<=======

=======>
a3.
ES Modules
    ES Modules (ESM) is the official JavaScript module system introduced in ES6 (2015).
    It's used in both browser and Node.js (modern versions).

    Why?
    * Native JavaScript module system.
    * Supports asynchronous loading.
    * Works in browsers and Node.js.
    * Supports tree-shaking (removing unused code).
<=======

=======>
a4.
REPL
    🔁 Read
    ⚙️ Eval
    📝 Print
    ⏹️ Loop
    It’s an interactive environment where you can run JavaScript code line-by-line — like a live playground!

    Why?
    * Test small pieces of code quickly 🧪
    * Debug expressions and functions 🐞
    * Explore Node.js APIs easily 🚀
    * No need to create a file or run node file.js 💡
<=======

=======>
a5.
NPM
    NPM stands for Node Package Manager.
    It’s the default package manager for Node.js.

    Why?
    * Install open-source packages (like express, mongoose)
    * Manage project dependencies
    * Run project scripts
    * Share your own packages
<=======

=======>
a6.
Environment Variables
    Environment Variables are key-value pairs used to store config values outside your code.
    🛡️ Useful for keeping sensitive info like passwords, API keys, and URLs secure and separate from code.

    Why?
    🔒 Security – avoid hardcoding secrets
    🔁 Portability – config changes without changing code
    📦 Environment-specific setup – dev, staging, production
<=======

=======>
a7.
fs module
    The fs module in Node.js lets you work with the file system — reading, writing, updating, and deleting 
    files or folders.

    Why?
    To Read, Write, Update, and Delete operations in file system

    How?
    Using fs module
    const fs = require('fs');
<=======

=======>
a8.
path module
    The path module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths in Node.js.
    📦 It's a built-in module — no need to install it.

    Why?
    * Makes file paths OS-independent (/ on mac/linux, \\ on Windows)
    * Helps join, resolve, normalize, extract paths
    * Prevents hardcoding file paths manually

    How?
    Using path module
    const path = require('path');
<=======

=======>
a9.
events module
    * The events module allows handling custom events.
    * You can create an event, listen for it, and trigger it.
    * 📦 It's a built-in module — no installation needed.

    Why?
    * Helps build event-driven systems (core idea behind Node.js)
    * Great for decoupling code — e.g., notify one part of your app when something happens in another

    How?
    using events module
    const EventEmitter = require('events');

    🛠️ How It Works
    * Create an event emitter
    * Listen for an event
    * Emit (trigger) the event
<=======

b1.
streams
    Streams are a way to read or write data piece by piece, instead of loading the entire data at once.
    👉 Useful for handling large files, video/audio, network data, etc.

    Why?
    | Without Streams         | With Streams              |
    |-------------------------|---------------------------|
    | Loads all data at once  | Handles data in chunks    |
    | Can crash on big files  | Memory efficient          |
    | Slower performance      | Fast and scalable         |

    Types?
    | Stream Type       | Purpose                 |
    |-------------------|-------------------------|
    | `Readable`        | Read data (e.g. from file) |
    | `Writable`        | Write data (e.g. to file)  |
    | `Duplex`          | Both read and write       |
    | `Transform`       | Modify data while streaming (e.g. compress)

    Common Modules That Use Streams
    * fs (file system)
    * http
    * zlib (compression)
    * net
    * crypto
<=======

=======>
b2.
buffers
    A Buffer is a way to handle binary data (like images, videos, or raw files) directly in memory.
    In Node.js, buffers are used when you’re dealing with streams, files, TCP sockets, or raw binary data.

    Why?
    * JavaScript normally deals with strings (text), but not raw binary.
    * Buffers help you store and manipulate binary data.
    * Very useful when working with fs, net, or stream modules.
<=======

=======>
b3.
http module
    The http module allows you to:
    * Create an HTTP server
    * Handle incoming requests
    * Send back responses
    
    You don’t need to install it — it’s built into Node.js.
<=======

=======>
b4.
os module
    The os module in Node.js provides information about the operating system — like CPU, memory, platform, etc.
    * It’s built-in. No need to install it.

    Why?
    * To get OS type (Windows, Linux, etc.)
    * To check free and total memory
    * To know CPU details
    * To get system uptime
    * To find current user info
    * To get home directory path
    * To check network details (like IP)
    * To write OS-based logic in apps
<=======

=======>
b5.
child_process
    The child_process module allows you to run system commands or scripts (like running a Python file, shell command, etc.) from a Node.js app.
    You can interact with external processes just like you would from a terminal.

    Why?
    * Run shell commands (ls, mkdir, etc.)
    * Execute other programs (e.g., Python, Java)
    * Create separate Node.js processes (for heavy work)
    * Automate system tasks
<=======

=======>
b6.
cluster
    The cluster module allows you to create child processes (workers) that all share the same server port.
    Node.js runs in a single thread. With cluster, you can use multiple CPU cores to improve performance — especially for HTTP servers.

    Why?
    * Utilize multi-core CPUs
    * Handle more requests concurrently
    * Improve server performance
    * Build scalable backend services

    How?
    You split the app into:
    * Master process – creates and manages workers
    * Worker processes – handle actual work (like HTTP requests)
<=======

=======>
b7.
process.exit()
    It’s a method in Node.js that immediately stops the Node.js process.

    Why?
    * Stop execution manually
    * Exit after completing a task
    * Exit with an error code on failure
    * End the program when a condition fails

    How? 
    process.exit([code]);
        code is an optional number that tells the OS why the process exited.
        0 → success (default)
        any other number → error/failure
<=======

=======>
b8.
process.argv
    process.argv is an array in Node.js that contains the command-line arguments passed when starting the script.

    Why?
    * To read user input from the command line
    * To build custom CLI tools
    * To change script behavior dynamically

    How?
    process.argv
