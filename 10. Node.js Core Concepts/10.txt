Global Objects
    Global Objects in Node.js are objects available in every module. You don't need to require them â€” 
    they are automatically available.

    Why?
    * Help you access useful values or functions anywhere in your code.
    * Reduce the need for importing common utilities.
    * Offer system-level functionalities like current directory, timers, buffer handling, etc.

CommonJS Modules

    It allows you to import and export code between files.

    Why?
    * Helps split code into reusable parts.
    * Keeps code organized and maintainable.
    * Built-in support in Node.js (no setup needed).
