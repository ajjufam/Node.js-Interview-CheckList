Protocol: ws:// (or wss:// for secure)
Unlike HTTP (which is request-response), WebSocket maintains an open connection so both client and server can 
send data at any time.

Why ?
Use WebSockets when you need:
* Real-time updates (e.g., chat apps, stock prices, online games)
* Lower latency communication
* Reduced HTTP overhead (no repeated headers for every interaction)
