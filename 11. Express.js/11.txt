Setup Express App
    Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to 
    build web and mobile applications. It simplifies handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and server-side logic.

    Why ?
    * Simplifies server creation — you don’t have to work with the raw Node.js HTTP module.
    * Routing made easy — organize your endpoints with clean and readable code.
    * Middleware support — easily add functionality like logging, authentication, error handling.
    * Extensible — integrates with many template engines, databases, and other Node.js libraries.
    * Lightweight and fast — minimal overhead, giving you control and performance.
